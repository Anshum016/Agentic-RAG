Agentic RAG GitHub Repo Summarizer: Setup and Usage Guide
This guide will walk you through setting up and running your GitHub Repository Summarizer project.

Step 1: Create key_param.py and Add Your API Keys
You need a file to store your sensitive API keys and connection strings securely.

In the root directory of your project, create a new Python file named key_param.py.

Add the following lines to the file, replacing the placeholder empty strings ("") with your actual credentials:

# key_param.py

# Your MongoDB Atlas Connection String URI
# Ensure it has read/write access to the database you will use for indexing.
MONGO_URI = "YOUR_MONGODB_ATLAS_CONNECTION_STRING"

# Your Google Gemini API Key
gemini_api_key = "YOUR_GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY"

# Your GitHub Personal Access Token
# This token needs read access to the repositories you want to index.
# IMPORTANT: Do NOT commit this file with your actual token to a public repository!
# Consider using environment variables for production.
GITHUB_TOKEN = "YOUR_GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN"

IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTE: Add key_param.py to your .gitignore file to prevent accidentally committing your secrets to Git. If you are using environment variables or a .env file approach (as discussed previously for the GitHub Token), update github_data_extractor.py and potentially other files to load keys from there instead of key_param.py, and ensure .env is also in .gitignore. For this guide, we assume key_param.py is used as the source for simplicity, but be mindful of security.

Step 2: Install Dependencies
Your project relies on several Python libraries. You can install them using pip.

Open your terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the root directory of your project.

Run the following command to install all necessary packages:

pip install pymongo langchain-community langchain-mongodb langchain-huggingface langchain-google-genai gradio google-generativeai requests python-dotenv

pymongo: For interacting with MongoDB.

langchain-community: Contains various community-contributed Langchain components.

langchain-mongodb: The specific Langchain integration for MongoDB Atlas Vector Search.

langchain-huggingface: For using HuggingFace models (like the embeddings).

langchain-google-genai: For integrating Google Gemini models with Langchain.

gradio: For building the web user interface.

google-generativeai: The official Google Generative AI library (used for configuring the API key).

requests: For making HTTP requests (used in github_data_extractor.py).

python-dotenv: Useful if you switch to loading secrets from a .env file (recommended).

Step 3: Index a GitHub Repository
Before you can query a repository, you need to fetch its data and index it into your MongoDB Atlas database.

Open your terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the root directory of your project.

Run the load_data.py script. You might need to modify this script to accept the repository owner and name as command-line arguments or hardcode them temporarily for the repository you want to index first. Ensure the script uses the correct MONGO_URI and GITHUB_TOKEN from key_param.py (or environment variables).

python load_data.py

(Modify load_data.py if needed to handle dynamic repo names for collection creation as discussed previously).

Wait for the script to complete. It will connect to MongoDB, fetch files from the specified GitHub repo, process them, generate embeddings, and store them in the configured MongoDB collection (Github_Rag.FirstTrial or a dynamically named collection).

Step 4: Run the Gradio Application
Once the data is indexed, you can start the web application to interact with it.

Open your terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the root directory of your project.

Run the extract_information.py script.

python extract_information.py

The script will initialize the MongoDB connection, load the embedding model, set up the agents, and launch the Gradio web server.

A local URL (usually http://127.0.0.1:7860/) will be displayed in your terminal. Open this URL in your web browser. If you used demo.launch(share=True), a public gradio.live URL will also be provided (use with caution).

Step 5: Use the Gradio Interface
Interact with your Agentic RAG summarizer through the web interface.

In the Gradio app, if you implemented dynamic repository loading, enter the GitHub Repository Owner and Repository Name that you indexed in Step 3.

Click the "Load Repository" button. Wait for the "Loading Status" to indicate success.

Once the repository is loaded, enter your question about its content or structure in the "Enter your Question about the Repository:" textbox.

Click the "Submit" button.

The "Agent's Answer" textbox will display the response generated by the specialized agents.

By following these steps, you should be able to set up, index data for, and interact with your Agentic RAG GitHub Repository Summarizer.
